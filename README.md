# Compiler Design: Lab Experiments

A repository for experiments performed in the Compiler Design lab as a part of the Compiler Design Course. All the programs are written in C++.

## _List of Experiments_
- Conversion of Non-Deterministic Finite Automata to Deterministic Finite Automata 
- Implementing a Deterministic Finite Automata
    - Constructing Deterministic Finite Automata
    - Checking for String Acceptance by DFA
- Implementing Lexical Analyzer
    - Constructing Lexical Analyzer
    - Tokenizing an input program
- Removing Left Recursion from given grammar
    - Removing Immediate Left Recursion
    - Removing Non-Immediate Left Recursion
- Removing Non-Determinism from given grammar
- Computing FIRST of all grammar symbols
- Computing FOLLOW of all non-terminals in a grammar
- Creating Parser Table for the LL(1) parser
